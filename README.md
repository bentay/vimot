# Really?  Why?

Sometimes I like vi-style motion.  At the same time, I really just
want Emacs to be Emacs.  I can't deal with viper or evil or whatever.
I just wanted the ability to quickly turn on vi-style motion, move
around, and then seamlessly hit Emacs-native keys and have them work
w/o any drama.

set-transient-map allows this exact functionality.  I'm sure that
there are 100 other implementations just like this, but hadn't
stumbled across them (didn't really look that hard), and I had 30
minutes to kill.
